  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 20, 2025</p>
  <p>Thank you for using Neko Code! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you interact with our Discord bot. By using the bot, you agree to this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the data essential for the bot‚Äôs functionality. This includes Guild ID, User ID, Channel ID, and optional command inputs. We do not collect private messages, passwords, or personal content beyond what is needed for bot operations.</p>

  <h2>2. Why We Collect Your Data</h2>
  <p>Data is collected solely to provide core features like economy tracking, moderation, tickets, and server setup. It allows us to remember server preferences and user actions across sessions for a seamless experience.</p>

  <h2>3. Where Data Is Stored</h2>
  <p>We store data using secure, access-controlled platforms such as Google Sheets, which are protected by OAuth credentials and restricted API scopes. All credentials are encrypted and managed through environment variables, ensuring only authorized processes can access them. No personal or sensitive data is stored in plain text or shared publicly at any time.</p>

  <h2>4. How Long We Keep Data</h2>
  <p>Data is retained only as long as necessary for functionality. For example, ticket data is cleared on closure, and economy data is reset on user request.</p>

  <h2>5. Who Has Access</h2>
  <p>Only the bot‚Äôs developer (Neko) and trusted contributors have access to stored data. Server admins can configure the bot, but cannot access private logs unless shared by their team directly.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use APIs like Google Sheets, Genius, or NASA for specific features. These services only interact with public data or bot-side information and never receive your Discord ID or private server data.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>You may request a copy of your data or ask us to delete it at any time. You can also remove consent by removing the bot from your server. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nekocode.in">support@nekocode.in</a> to proceed.</p>

  <h2>8. Consent</h2>
  <p>By using the bot, you consent to the processing of relevant data for core features. This includes logging your actions for moderation, economy tracking, or ticket identification where needed.</p>

  <h2>9. Minors</h2>
  <p>This bot is not intended for use by individuals under 13 years of age or the age required by local law. Server owners are responsible for ensuring compliance with Discord‚Äôs policies regarding minors.</p>

  <h2>10. Custom Commands & Inputs</h2>
  <p>Any user-generated content (like ticket messages or slash command inputs) is stored only for the intended function. It is not shared, reused, or analyzed beyond its original purpose.</p>

  <h2>11. Tickets</h2>
  <p>When using the ticketing feature, your requests or queries are not stored by us directly. They exist only as messages within the Discord thread where the ticket was created. These messages are visible only to the server‚Äôs staff roles as defined by your server's configuration. Once the thread is closed or deleted, the contents are no longer accessible unless your server admins choose to archive them.</p>

  <h2>12. Analytics & Logs</h2>
  <p>We collect non-identifiable metrics like command usage and error logs. These help us debug and improve the bot. We do not track individual user behavior beyond what is required for the feature used.</p>

  <h2>13. No Advertising</h2>
  <p>We do not sell user data or serve ads. If we ever add premium features, you will be clearly informed. Your data is not shared with any third-party advertisers or partners.</p>

  <h2>14. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>We implement bot-side validation, secure credentials, and rate-limiting to prevent misuse. All configurations and tokens are kept private using environment files and secure hosting solutions.</p>

  <h2>15. DM Behavior</h2>
  <p>The bot may message you in DMs to confirm tickets, for usage of specific commands like password generator or whisper, or send alerts if enabled by the developer. We do not log these DMs or use them for any tracking or advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>16. Leaving a Server</h2>
  <p>If the bot is removed from a server, we do not automatically delete configuration or user data. All data is retained securely and can be deleted upon explicit request by the server owner or the user concerned. This allows for smoother restoration if the bot is re-added, or for auditing purposes if needed. We do not share or reuse this data for any purpose outside the original server context.</p>

  <h2>17. Command Usage History</h2>
  <p>We don‚Äôt permanently store command histories. However, features like economy or reminders may store last used timestamps. These are only used for cooldowns or anti-spam protection.</p>

  <h2>18. Backups</h2>
  <p>We regularly back up all data, including ticket information, server configurations, and economy states, to ensure stability and prevent data loss in the event of a crash, reset, or unexpected issue. All backups are encrypted and stored securely with strict access controls. No backup data is accessible to anyone outside the bot's internal systems and is used solely for restoration or debugging purposes.</p>

  <h2>19. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. Major changes will be announced via the bot, website, or support server. Continuing to use the bot means you accept the revised policy.</p>

  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
  <p>You agree to use Neko Code responsibly and legally. This includes avoiding misuse, harassment, spamming, impersonation, or breaking local laws using the bot. Failure to comply may result in bans or restrictions. We aim to provide a safe and respectful bot experience for all users, and improper use disrupts that goal.</p>

  <h2>2. User Eligibility</h2>
  <p>Users must be at least 13 years old or the minimum age in their country to use Neko Code. This aligns with Discord's rules and protects minors. We do not knowingly store data from underage users, and their access may be revoked if found violating this policy.</p>

  <h2>3. Account Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are fully responsible for any actions taken through your Discord account while using the bot. If your account is compromised, report it immediately. We do not hold liability for damages caused by unauthorized use of your account.</p>

  <h2>4. Bot Availability</h2>
  <p>We aim to keep Neko Code available 24/7, but we cannot guarantee uptime. Downtime may occur due to maintenance, updates, or third-party outages. We are not liable for disruptions in availability or lost features due to temporary outages.</p>

  <h2>5. Feature Changes</h2>
  <p>The bot's features may change without prior notice. Commands may be updated, renamed, or removed for performance, compliance, or usability reasons. Continued use means acceptance of these changes. We aim to improve and evolve regularly based on feedback.</p>

  <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>If you use the bot to submit, store, or share content (like messages, reports, or ticket requests), you are responsible for ensuring that it is lawful, respectful, and non-abusive. We do not actively monitor all user content, but we reserve the right to remove anything that violates our policies. You agree not to submit harmful, infringing, or offensive content while using the bot.</p>

  <h2>7. Community Conduct</h2>
  <p>Use the bot respectfully and avoid toxic behavior, harassment, hate speech, or offensive content. Violations may result in bans or reports to Discord Trust & Safety. We want to foster a positive community environment across all servers.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We only collect essential data such as user IDs, server IDs, and command logs to improve the bot and prevent abuse. This data is never sold and is used internally only. Using the bot means you agree to this minimal data usage.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>You may request to delete your data by contacting our support. After verifying your identity, we will remove all personally identifiable data unless it’s required to comply with legal obligations. Data deletion may impact your bot experience.</p>

  <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
  <p>We prioritize your privacy. Your data is stored securely and never shared externally unless required by law. We never log private message content or personal metadata. Using the bot confirms that you agree to our privacy practices.</p>

  <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Neko Code integrates with services like Genius and Google Sheets. Using those features means you also agree to their terms. We are not responsible for their content, outages, or privacy policies. If they limit access, related features may stop working.</p>

  <h2>12. Bot Moderation</h2>
  <p>Bot logs may be reviewed to identify abuse or bugs. While we don’t store full message history, moderation actions may be logged for accountability. Servers or users misusing moderation features may lose access to certain commands.</p>

  <h2>13. Rate Limiting</h2>
  <p>To prevent abuse or overload, commands may be subject to cooldowns or rate limits. These are not punishments but are safeguards for fair use. Excessive misuse may result in longer cooldowns or global bans per server.</p>

  <h2>14. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement basic security protocols to protect our systems. However, we cannot guarantee total protection. Please report any bugs or vulnerabilities rather than exploiting them. Malicious behavior may result in bans or legal action.</p>

  <h2>15. Feedback</h2>
  <p>We value your suggestions and bug reports. By submitting them, you grant us the right to use, modify, or implement your feedback without compensation. We cannot promise to act on every idea but will consider each one respectfully.</p>

  <h2>16. Server Ownership Verification</h2>
  <p>Advanced configuration or management features are only accessible by verified server owners or admins. If verification fails, we may deny access to prevent abuse or security issues. This keeps servers safe from unauthorized changes.</p>

  <h2>17. Support and Communication</h2>
  <p>Official support is offered through our Discord and email. Please be respectful when contacting us. Spam or abusive language may result in limited support or blacklisting. While we aim to respond quickly, delays are possible during busy periods.</p>

  <h2>18. Termination of Access</h2>
  <p>We may block or remove access to the bot for users or servers that break these terms, abuse commands, or threaten bot stability. This can happen without prior notice, especially in severe cases. Some bans may be permanent.</p>

  <h2>19. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>You agree to comply with all local laws when using Neko Code. We are not responsible for illegal activity performed using the bot. If required, we will cooperate with law enforcement or Discord’s legal requests.</p>

  <h2>20. Updates to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may change these Terms at any time. You are responsible for reviewing them periodically. Continued use of the bot after updates means you accept the revised terms. If you disagree, please stop using the service.</p>

    <h2>21. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us via our <a href="https://nekocode.in/discord">Support Server</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:support@nekocode.in">support@nekocode.in</a>.</p>

    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 21, 2025</p>
    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      By using Neko Code, you agree to interact with the bot in a manner that is
      lawful, respectful, and aligned with Discord’s Terms of Service. The bot
      is provided to enhance your server experience through features such as
      moderation, economy systems, entertainment commands, and integrations with
      external APIs. Misuse of the bot disrupts the purpose of offering a safe
      and enjoyable experience for all users. Prohibited activities include, but
      are not limited to, spamming commands excessively, attempting to overload
      the bot’s infrastructure, impersonating other users, distributing harmful
      or malicious content, or using the bot in ways that break local, national,
      or international laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also prohibited from attempting to bypass restrictions such as
      command cooldowns, rate limits, or feature limitations imposed to ensure
      stability. Any exploitation of bugs, security flaws, or loopholes without
      reporting them to the development team is considered a violation of these
      Terms. If such misuse is detected, we reserve the right to limit, suspend,
      or terminate your access to the bot immediately, with or without prior
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage responsible usage, where servers configure commands
      appropriately and users engage with the bot respectfully. The intent is to
      create a fair environment where features can be used for fun,
      productivity, or community management. Continued use of Neko Code implies
      you acknowledge these responsibilities and accept that improper use could
      result in disciplinary action including bans, restrictions, or even legal
      consequences depending on the severity of the misuse.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Neko Code is only available to users who are at least 13 years old or meet
      the minimum age required by the laws of their country, whichever is
      higher. This rule ensures compliance with Discord’s own age restrictions
      and protects minors from inappropriate exposure to online communities. If
      you are under the required age, you are not permitted to use the bot, and
      any data associated with your account may be removed upon discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect or store data from underage users. If we
      become aware of such cases, we will take immediate action, which could
      include notifying the server administrators, and
      deleting related data. Parents or guardians who believe their child is
      using Neko Code in violation of these rules are encouraged to contact us
      directly so we can review and remove the data if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, by using the bot, you affirm that you have the authority to
      consent to these Terms of Service. If you are joining a server on behalf
      of an organization, you confirm that you have permission from the
      organization to use the bot and agree that the organization will also be
      bound by these Terms. Eligibility also means having access to a valid
      Discord account, as well as complying with Discord’s Community Guidelines.
      We reserve the right to deny service if eligibility requirements are not
      met.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      You, as the account holder, are solely responsible for all actions
      performed through your Discord account while interacting with Neko Code.
      Whether commands are issued intentionally or through unauthorized access,
      all activities tied to your account will be considered your
      responsibility. It is strongly recommended that you keep your Discord
      account secure by enabling two-factor authentication, using a strong
      password, and avoiding suspicious third-party links.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your account becomes compromised, you must notify both Discord and our
      support team immediately. While we may assist in preventing further damage
      by blocking certain activities, we cannot retroactively undo all
      consequences caused by unauthorized access. Neko Code does not accept
      liability for damages, losses, or penalties incurred due to compromised
      accounts, negligence in securing credentials, or failure to report
      suspicious activity promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users must also refrain from sharing their accounts with others,
      especially for administrative or bot management purposes. Doing so
      increases the risk of misuse and complicates accountability. If suspicious
      or abusive actions are traced back to your account, you may face
      restrictions, regardless of whether those actions were personally carried
      out by you. By using the service, you acknowledge this accountability and
      agree to take proactive steps to safeguard your account. Proper account
      responsibility ensures a fair and safe experience for both you and your
      community.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Bot Availability</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to keep Neko Code available 24/7, uninterrupted service
      cannot be guaranteed. The bot runs on third-party hosting providers and
      may be affected by network outages, server crashes, or unexpected
      technical issues beyond our immediate control. Additionally, updates and
      scheduled maintenance may temporarily make the bot unavailable. We work
      diligently to minimize downtime, but you should be prepared for occasional
      interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Server administrators are encouraged to have backup moderation tools or
      contingency plans in place, especially if Neko Code is a critical part of
      server management. Since downtime may occur without prior notice, reliance
      on the bot as the sole enforcement tool is not advisable. While we aim to
      resolve issues quickly, we cannot be held responsible for damages such as
      lost productivity, interrupted events, or inconvenience caused by service
      outages.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also reserve the right to temporarily suspend services to perform
      upgrades, security patches, or testing of new features. These measures are
      in the best interest of stability and long-term improvements. Your
      continued use acknowledges that 100% uptime cannot be expected and that
      occasional interruptions are a natural part of operating online services.
      By using Neko Code, you agree that we are not liable for outages, data
      loss, or disruptions resulting from downtime, whether planned or
      unplanned.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Feature Changes</h2>
    <p>
      Neko Code is constantly evolving to provide a better user experience. This
      means that features, commands, or integrations may change without advance
      warning. Updates may involve renaming commands, adjusting functionality,
      or removing certain options altogether. These changes are made to improve
      performance, ensure compliance with Discord’s rules, or adapt to
      third-party services that we integrate with, such as Genius or Google
      Sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this evolving nature, we cannot guarantee that a feature you
      rely on today will remain available indefinitely. We encourage users to
      stay informed through our changelogs, announcements in our support server,
      and documentation. If a feature is removed or changed, it is typically
      done with the long-term stability and security of the bot in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      By continuing to use Neko Code, you accept that adjustments to features
      are part of the service. We are not obligated to maintain specific
      functionality permanently, especially when it poses risks, conflicts with
      Discord’s policies, or proves unsustainable. While we value feedback and
      often prioritize user-requested improvements, final decisions regarding
      features rest with the development team. Your ongoing use of the bot
      constitutes agreement to adapt to these changes as they occur.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      Neko Code may allow users to generate, store, or share content, such as
      messages, reports, tickets, or custom inputs for commands. You are fully
      responsible for ensuring that any content you submit through the bot is
      lawful, respectful, and free of harmful or infringing material. This
      includes avoiding abusive language, spamming, offensive media, harassment,
      or sharing content that violates intellectual property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not actively monitor every message or piece of content submitted
      through the bot. However, we reserve the right to review, remove, or
      restrict access to content that violates these Terms, Discord’s Community
      Guidelines, or applicable laws. Server administrators are encouraged to
      configure moderation settings responsibly to minimize the risk of
      inappropriate content being processed through the bot.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the bot to submit content, you grant us a limited license to
      store and process that data for functionality purposes. For example, a
      support ticket system may require saving your request until it is
      resolved. We do not claim ownership of your content, nor do we share it
      outside of its intended use. Nonetheless, by submitting content, you agree
      not to upload anything malicious, illegal, or otherwise damaging. Abuse of
      content submission features may lead to restrictions, bans, or reporting
      to Discord Trust & Safety. Ultimately, you are accountable for your
      contributions, and servers using Neko Code are expected to enforce proper
      community conduct.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Community Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      When using Neko Code, you are expected to uphold respectful and positive
      behavior both within your server and in interactions with our support
      team. Toxicity, harassment, hate speech, and offensive or discriminatory
      behavior are strictly prohibited. This includes direct insults, slurs,
      threats, or any actions that create an unsafe or hostile environment for
      other users. We aim to foster communities where people feel welcome and
      safe, and misuse of the bot to engage in toxic conduct undermines this
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to use the bot to spread harmful content, including but not
      limited to spam messages, phishing attempts, malware, or harmful links.
      Additionally, automated or botting activities designed to exploit features
      for unfair advantage are not tolerated. We may, at our discretion,
      implement stricter rules on specific servers where issues of misconduct
      arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a violation of community conduct occurs, we may take action ranging
      from issuing warnings, restricting command access, reporting offenders to
      server moderators, or permanently banning the offending user from Neko
      Code entirely. Repeat or severe violations may be escalated to Discord’s
      Trust & Safety team for further enforcement. By using the bot, you
      acknowledge your responsibility to contribute positively to communities,
      and that violations may result in both in-bot penalties and server-based
      consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      To provide reliable and functional services, Neko Code collects only the
      minimal data necessary for operation. This may include Discord user IDs,
      server IDs, command usage logs, and configuration settings such as
      prefixes or economy balances. This data is essential for ensuring that
      features like leaderboards, moderation logs, and ticket systems work
      correctly. Without collecting these basics, the bot would not be able to
      provide consistent functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share your information with third parties. Data
      is stored securely and used solely to improve the performance, stability,
      and safety of the bot. For example, logging command usage helps us
      identify abuse, fix bugs, and introduce improvements. Data collection also
      allows us to detect patterns of spamming, harassment, or other forms of
      misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the bot, you agree to this minimal and transparent data
      collection. If you are uncomfortable with this, your only option is to
      discontinue use of the service. We remain committed to limiting data
      storage to only what is absolutely necessary and avoiding unnecessary
      collection of personal information, such as private message content or
      unrelated metadata. You can find details of what data is collected in our
      documentation or request clarification through our support channels.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You have the right to request deletion of the data that Neko Code has
      collected about you. This process is designed to give you greater control
      over your privacy. To initiate a deletion request, you must contact our
      support team either via our official Discord support server or through
      email. We will verify your identity to ensure that the request is
      legitimate and not being made by someone else attempting to compromise
      your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once verified, we will proceed to delete all personally identifiable data
      tied to your account, such as stored economy balances, configuration
      preferences, or activity logs, unless retention is required by law or
      necessary to resolve disputes. For example, if your account is involved in
      an ongoing moderation case, we may be required to retain certain logs
      until the case concludes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that deletion of your data may impact your experience with
      Neko Code. Features dependent on saved information, such as server
      configurations or economy tracking, may no longer function properly. By
      requesting deletion, you accept that certain features will be reset or
      become unavailable. We aim to process deletion requests within a
      reasonable time frame, though delays may occur during periods of high
      demand. Ultimately, we respect your right to privacy and will honor
      legitimate requests promptly while maintaining compliance with legal
      obligations.
    </p>
    <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your privacy is a top priority in the operation of Neko Code. We
      understand that trust is essential when using a Discord bot that interacts
      with your servers and communities. To that end, we are committed to
      protecting the limited data that is collected. We do not log or monitor
      private message content, nor do we attempt to access personal metadata
      such as IP addresses or device identifiers. The information that is
      collected, such as server IDs, user IDs, and command usage logs, is stored
      securely and only accessed by authorized members of the development team
      when required for maintenance, debugging, or abuse prevention.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share your data with advertisers, marketers, or external
      organizations. Data is used internally to improve the functionality of the
      bot and ensure a smooth user experience. For example, logs may be used to
      detect whether a feature is malfunctioning or being exploited. In rare
      cases, we may disclose limited information if legally required to do so,
      such as complying with a valid law enforcement request or fulfilling
      Discord’s legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the bot confidently knowing that your conversations, private
      messages, and server discussions are not monitored. However, you must also
      take responsibility for what you submit through the bot’s features. If you
      share sensitive information through custom commands or ticket systems, be
      aware that such data may be temporarily stored for functionality purposes.
      We recommend avoiding the submission of highly confidential information.
      By continuing to use Neko Code, you agree to these privacy practices and
      acknowledge that while we implement safeguards, no online service can
      guarantee absolute protection.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Certain features of Neko Code rely on integrations with external services
      such as Genius for lyrics, Google Sheets for database-like functionality,
      or other APIs that extend the bot’s capabilities. When you use commands or
      systems that rely on these integrations, you also agree to comply with the
      terms and policies of those third-party providers. For instance, if you
      use the lyrics command powered by Genius, their terms of use regarding
      content and access also apply to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we make every effort to ensure smooth integration, we cannot
      guarantee that third-party services will remain consistently available. If
      they experience outages, change their APIs, or impose stricter limits,
      corresponding features in Neko Code may be reduced, altered, or entirely
      removed. We are not responsible for failures or inaccuracies caused by
      external services, nor for how those providers handle data on their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that by using features tied to external services, your
      data may pass through those systems in accordance with their privacy
      policies. For example, when interacting with Google Sheets, stored data is
      handled according to Google’s terms. We encourage users to review these
      external policies to understand how their data may be treated. Continued
      use of Neko Code features connected to third parties means you accept
      these conditions. Should third-party access be revoked or restricted, you
      understand that we are not liable for any resulting loss of functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Bot Moderation</h2>
    <p>
      Neko Code includes moderation-related features that allow server
      administrators to manage communities more effectively. These features may
      include logging moderation actions, recording warnings, muting users, or
      providing tools to track offenses. While the bot is not designed to store
      full message history, moderation logs may be preserved for accountability.
      Such records are useful in maintaining transparency within communities and
      ensuring that moderation actions are properly documented.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the bot’s moderation tools, you acknowledge that some actions
      will be logged. These logs may be visible to server administrators and
      authorized staff, but they are not shared outside of the server
      environment unless explicitly configured. Abuse of moderation
      features—such as unfairly targeting individuals, falsifying records, or
      bypassing restrictions—is prohibited. If abuse is detected, we may revoke
      access to moderation-related commands for specific users or entire
      servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moderation data is treated as sensitive, and while we strive to secure it,
      ultimate responsibility lies with the server owners and administrators who
      configure these tools. Neko Code should be used as a support system for
      fair enforcement of community rules, not as a tool for harassment or
      unjust punishment. We may also review logs ourselves if a report of abuse
      is filed, but we will never interfere with normal server operations
      without reason. By using these features, you agree that moderation logs
      may exist, and you consent to their storage for accountability and safety.
    </p>
    <h2>13. Rate Limiting</h2>
    <p>
      To maintain fairness and stability, Neko Code applies rate limits and
      cooldowns to certain commands. These measures are not meant to punish
      users but rather to ensure that the bot remains accessible and functional
      for everyone across all servers. Rate limits prevent users from
      overloading the system by issuing too many requests in a short time frame,
      which could cause lag, crashes, or degraded performance. For example,
      popular commands like economy transactions or search integrations may have
      cooldowns of several seconds or minutes depending on their intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempting to bypass or exploit these rate limits is strictly prohibited.
      This includes using multiple accounts, automated scripts, or botnets to
      issue commands faster than intended. Such actions undermine the stability
      of the bot and may lead to temporary or permanent bans. We reserve the
      right to adjust cooldowns, modify rate limits, or introduce new
      restrictions without prior notice if we detect abuse or system strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that rate limits apply globally across all servers
      where Neko Code is active. This ensures that one community cannot
      monopolize system resources at the expense of others. By using the bot,
      you accept that occasional delays or limitations are necessary trade-offs
      for fairness and performance. Users are encouraged to respect these
      limitations and use the bot responsibly. If you encounter unexpected
      cooldowns or restrictions, it may be due to global usage spikes. Continued
      use of Neko Code implies agreement with these safeguards, and repeated
      attempts to bypass them may result in extended restrictions or removal of
      access altogether.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take security seriously and have implemented basic protocols to protect
      the systems that power Neko Code. Our infrastructure is regularly
      monitored for vulnerabilities, and updates are applied as necessary to
      reduce risks. However, no system can guarantee absolute security. As a
      user, you play a crucial role in maintaining the safety of your account
      and server. This includes avoiding suspicious third-party bots, keeping
      your Discord credentials secure, and reporting vulnerabilities responsibly
      if you discover them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities in Neko Code is strictly forbidden. If
      you identify a potential security issue, you are required to report it
      directly to our development team instead of attempting to exploit it for
      personal gain. Responsible disclosure helps us improve the bot for
      everyone, while malicious exploitation may result in bans, loss of access,
      or even legal action depending on severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not liable for damages caused by external threats such as account
      hacks, Discord platform breaches, or issues caused by third-party
      integrations. While we aim to secure your data and minimize risks, users
      must understand that complete protection cannot be guaranteed. By
      continuing to use Neko Code, you acknowledge these limitations and agree
      to take reasonable measures to protect your own accounts and servers.
      Security is a shared responsibility, and working together helps keep the
      community safe.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      We value the input of our community and encourage users to submit
      suggestions, bug reports, and feature requests. Feedback is an essential
      part of the development process, allowing us to identify areas for
      improvement and prioritize updates that benefit the largest number of
      users. Whether through our Discord support server, email, or feedback
      forms, your contributions are always welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      By submitting feedback, you grant us the right to review, adapt, and
      implement your ideas in future versions of Neko Code. This license is
      non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free, meaning we can freely use the
      ideas you provide without the obligation to compensate you. While we
      strive to consider all feedback, we cannot promise that every suggestion
      will be implemented. Final decisions rest with the development team, who
      must balance requests with technical feasibility, security considerations,
      and the broader needs of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that suggestions provided may be used to create features,
      modifications, or updates that resemble your original idea. By offering
      feedback, you waive any claims of ownership or entitlement to features
      that result from it. We encourage constructive and respectful
      communication, as toxic or spammy submissions may be ignored. Ultimately,
      we see feedback as a partnership with our users: you provide insights from
      your perspective, and we work to build the best possible experience for
      everyone using the bot.
    </p>
    <h2>16. Server Ownership Verification</h2>
    <p>
      Certain advanced configuration or management features in Neko Code are
      only accessible by verified server owners or administrators with
      sufficient permissions. This requirement exists to ensure that sensitive
      actions such as modifying economy settings, changing moderation logs, or
      adjusting global configurations are performed only by individuals who are
      authorized to do so. Verification typically relies on Discord’s built-in
      permission system, which recognizes roles such as “Server Owner” or
      “Administrator.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If ownership or administrative rights cannot be verified, we reserve the
      right to deny access to specific features. This safeguard prevents
      malicious actors from impersonating server owners or exploiting loopholes
      to gain unauthorized control over configurations. For example, someone
      attempting to reset economy balances or alter moderation records without
      proper authority will be blocked from doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Server owners are encouraged to manage their permissions responsibly by
      assigning administrative privileges only to trusted individuals.
      Mismanagement of roles or permissions is not the responsibility of Neko
      Code. If a server experiences damage due to misuse by an authorized admin,
      we cannot intervene or reverse the consequences. By using the bot, you
      acknowledge that server verification is essential for security and that
      our systems may restrict access when verification fails. These measures
      are in place to protect both the integrity of the bot and the safety of
      your community.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Support and Communication</h2>
    <p>
      We provide official support channels to help users resolve issues, ask
      questions, or submit feedback. These include our official Discord support
      server and our support email address. When contacting us, users are
      expected to be respectful, patient, and clear in describing their
      concerns. Abusive language, spam, or harassment directed toward support
      staff will not be tolerated and may result in reduced support
      availability, blacklisting, or permanent denial of assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we aim to respond promptly to inquiries, response times may vary
      depending on demand, staff availability, and the complexity of the issue.
      In cases of widespread outages, announcements will be made through
      official channels, and we ask for patience as we work toward a resolution.
      Users should also consult the official documentation or FAQs before
      reaching out, as many common questions are already addressed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may occasionally send announcements, updates, or important notices
      through our support channels. By using Neko Code, you agree to receive
      these communications as part of the service. However, we will not use
      these channels for spam or irrelevant advertising. Respectful
      communication is the key to maintaining a healthy support system, and by
      contacting us, you agree to engage constructively.
    </p>

    <h2>18. Termination of Access</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend, block, or permanently terminate access to
      Neko Code for users or servers that violate these Terms of Service, abuse
      bot features, or engage in activities that threaten the stability of the
      system. Termination may occur with or without prior notice, depending on
      the severity of the violation. For example, attempting to exploit
      vulnerabilities, harassing other users through the bot, or engaging in
      repeated misuse despite warnings may result in immediate termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less severe cases, temporary restrictions or warnings may be issued
      first, giving users the opportunity to correct their behavior. However,
      repeated violations or failure to comply with the rules may escalate to
      permanent bans. Termination decisions are final and may not always be
      reversible, especially when implemented to protect the safety and
      stability of the bot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servers or users affected by termination may lose access to all stored
      configurations, balances, or logs associated with their accounts. We are
      not liable for damages, losses, or disruptions caused by termination of
      access. By using the bot, you acknowledge that failure to follow these
      Terms could result in restrictions and that we hold the authority to
      enforce these actions at our discretion. The goal of this policy is not to
      punish, but to ensure a safe, fair, and stable environment for all users.
    </p>
    <h2>19. Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      By using Neko Code, you agree to comply with all applicable local,
      national, and international laws. This includes but is not limited to
      regulations regarding online conduct, digital safety, data protection, and
      intellectual property rights. The bot is intended to enhance your Discord
      experience through moderation, entertainment, and productivity features,
      but it must not be used as a tool for unlawful activities. Examples of
      prohibited conduct include using the bot to spread pirated material,
      engage in harassment, promote hate speech, or coordinate illegal
      activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for the actions of users or servers that choose to
      misuse the bot in violation of the law. However, if illegal activity is
      reported or detected, we reserve the right to take immediate action,
      including restricting access, reporting offenders to Discord Trust &
      Safety, or cooperating with law enforcement when necessary. In cases where
      we are legally compelled to provide data, we will only disclose the
      minimum amount of information required and in accordance with applicable
      laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the bot aligns with the
      legal requirements of your jurisdiction. For example, if certain content
      or services are restricted in your country, you must refrain from using
      related features in violation of those rules. By continuing to use Neko
      Code, you acknowledge this responsibility and agree that we are not liable
      for any legal consequences that arise from your misuse. Compliance ensures
      that the bot can remain a safe and lawful service for all users, and
      violations may result in both termination of access and legal
      consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>20. Updates to the Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service are subject to change as Neko Code evolves. Updates
      may be made to reflect new features, changes in legal requirements,
      improvements in security, or adjustments to our policies. We reserve the
      right to modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. However,
      when significant updates are introduced, we will attempt to notify users
      through announcements in our support server or updates on our official
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to stay
      informed about changes. Continued use of the bot after updates are
      published constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. If you disagree
      with the updated Terms, you must stop using the bot immediately and, if
      desired, request data deletion. Failure to review changes does not exempt
      you from compliance, as the updated Terms apply universally to all users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updates to the Terms are designed to keep the service fair, secure, and
      compliant with evolving standards. For example, if Discord introduces new
      policies regarding bot operations, our Terms may change to reflect those
      requirements. Likewise, if we add new features such as advanced
      integrations, corresponding rules may be introduced. By continuing to use
      Neko Code, you acknowledge that these updates are necessary for the
      long-term stability and legality of the service.
    </p>

    <h2>21. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions, concerns, or feedback regarding these Terms of
      Service or any aspect of Neko Code, you can reach us through our official
      support channels. The primary methods of contact include our Discord
      Support Server, available at
      <a href="https://nekocode.in/discord">https://nekocode.in/discord</a>, and
      our email address,
      <a href="mailto:support@nekocode.in">support@nekocode.in</a>. These
      channels are actively monitored, and we strive to respond in a timely and
      professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When contacting us, please provide as much detail as possible about your
      issue. This helps us understand and resolve your concerns more
      effectively. If your inquiry relates to data deletion, account security,
      or a Terms violation, we may ask for verification to confirm your identity
      before proceeding. This ensures that sensitive requests are handled
      securely and responsibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome respectful communication and constructive feedback. However,
      abusive or spammy contact attempts may result in limited support. Our team
      is committed to providing assistance within reasonable time frames, though
      delays can occur during periods of high activity. By reaching out, you
      agree to engage in good faith, and we will do our best to support you.
      These channels are the official sources of communication, and any other
      impersonating accounts or unauthorized channels should be ignored and
      reported.
    </p>

    <h2>22. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      By using Neko Code, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
      bot developers, contributors, and affiliated entities from and against any
      claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from your use or
      misuse of the service. This includes, but is not limited to, violations of
      these Terms, breaches of third-party rights, illegal activity conducted
      through the bot, or disputes arising from your server’s implementation of
      the bot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indemnification means that if your actions cause harm, financial loss, or
      legal disputes, you assume full responsibility rather than transferring
      that burden to us. For example, if you use the bot to share copyrighted
      material without authorization and legal action is taken, you are solely
      responsible for the outcome. Similarly, if your server members misuse the
      bot and it leads to conflicts, you bear the responsibility for managing
      those consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This clause ensures fairness by protecting the developers and contributors
      who provide the bot as a free or low-cost service. By accepting these
      Terms, you acknowledge that the risk of misuse lies with the user and that
      we cannot be held liable for behavior we do not control. This protection
      allows us to continue offering Neko Code while ensuring accountability
      remains with those who directly control its usage.
    </p>

    <h2>23. Data Accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      Neko Code processes and stores certain types of data to provide its
      features, including but not limited to server settings, economy balances,
      ticket logs, and usage records. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of
      this data, we cannot guarantee that all information will always remain up
      to date, error-free, or free from corruption. Technical issues, API
      failures, user errors, or unexpected bugs may cause discrepancies in
      stored or displayed information.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that data generated or managed by Neko Code should not be
      considered authoritative or official records. For example, economy
      balances are intended for entertainment purposes and should not be equated
      to real-world financial tracking. Similarly, logs maintained by the bot
      are not a substitute for legal or official documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that users back up important data (e.g., economy sheets or
      ticket transcripts) independently, especially if relying on the bot for
      server management. If data corruption, loss, or inaccuracies occur, we
      will make reasonable efforts to investigate and, where possible, restore
      the data. However, we cannot be held liable for damages resulting from
      such issues. By using Neko Code, you agree to use the bot with an
      understanding of these limitations and accept the risk of occasional data
      errors.
    </p>

    <h2>24. Payment and Premium Services</h2>
    <p>
      While many features of Neko Code are free, certain advanced or
      resource-intensive functionalities may be offered as premium services.
      Payment terms, pricing, and available tiers will be clearly stated prior
      to purchase. By subscribing to premium features, you agree to provide
      accurate billing information and authorize us to process payments through
      our chosen provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      All payments are generally non-refundable unless explicitly stated
      otherwise. Exceptions may be made at our discretion in cases of technical
      failure, duplicate charges, or other verified billing errors. Misuse of
      payment systems, including chargebacks without valid cause, may result in
      suspension or permanent banning from the bot and related services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Premium benefits may include higher resource limits, priority support, or
      exclusive features. These offerings may change over time as we update the
      bot. Continued payment of subscription fees is required to maintain access
      to premium features. If a subscription lapses, affected features may be
      suspended without notice. By purchasing premium services, you acknowledge
      that offerings are subject to change, and refunds will not be provided due
      to feature modifications unless otherwise required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>25. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Purchases made for Neko Code’s premium services are considered final and
      non-refundable, except in cases explicitly covered by our refund policy.
      Refunds may be granted if: (a) the service was not delivered as promised,
      (b) you were charged multiple times in error, or (c) technical issues on
      our side made the purchased feature entirely unusable for a substantial
      period. Requests for refunds must be submitted within 14 days of the
      purchase date, along with proof of transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds will not be issued for reasons such as dissatisfaction with a
      feature that was properly delivered, failure to read the service
      description, or loss of access due to violations of these Terms.
      Additionally, partial refunds for unused subscription time are generally
      not provided unless required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We process approved refunds through the original payment method, and
      processing times may vary depending on the payment provider. Users who
      repeatedly request refunds without valid cause, or who initiate
      chargebacks, may be permanently banned from using premium services. By
      purchasing any paid feature, you agree to these refund conditions and
      accept that our refund policy is designed to balance fairness with
      protection against abuse.
    </p>

    <h2>26. Beta Features</h2>
    <p>
      From time to time, Neko Code may release experimental or “beta” features
      that are still in testing. These features may be incomplete, unstable, or
      subject to significant change before final release. By opting into beta
      features, you acknowledge that they are provided “as is” with no
      guarantees of performance, stability, or availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beta features may be enabled automatically or upon request, depending on
      the nature of the testing program. Participation may require you to
      provide feedback, report issues, or agree to additional terms. We reserve
      the right to modify or remove beta features at any time without notice,
      and participation does not guarantee continued access once the feature
      reaches general availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse or exploit beta features in ways that could harm
      the bot, its users, or the development process. Any data generated while
      using beta features may be deleted at the conclusion of the testing phase.
      We are not liable for any damages, disruptions, or data loss arising from
      the use of beta features. By participating, you accept the risks and
      understand that these features are experimental in nature.
